		Hello I am Kevin, currently pursuing BCA(Hons.) from GGSIPU, Delhi. I have an interest for the technical sides of a game though it may be a delusion but I love it. 
		<br> With no prior coding knowledge, I have still made some improvements for games. <br> I have created a widescreen HUD fix for Cricket 07 which adapts the game to 16:9 through editing of rfe files which is basically a xml file, though some files are encrypted I still managed to align them. 
		<br> Similarly I made widescreen FOV fixes for Cricket 2004 and Brian Lara Cricket 99 <br> Talking about Brian Lara Cricket 99, the game being released in 1998, had it's own limitations, one of them being the low quality audio. 
		When I was surfing through the game files, I found out that the game audio files are originally uncompressed PCM .WAV files at 44.1khz. <br> But the game played them at 22.5 khz. I had no idea how did the code work but I had an understanding that the game exe had an int value for the audio sample rate. <br> And I just went into HxD, searched for 22500 within 16 bit integer, with hit and trial, the 4th value was the toggle, changed it to 44.1 khz and BOOM!, the game now played the audio at a better and matching audio quality.<br>
		That's what I want to tell, I have a will to discover something when I am deep into the domain, when I am actually interested in that project.
